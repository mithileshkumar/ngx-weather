# NgxWeather

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.

# Hosted location

Without location propmt as it's not having secure connection (http://rionzz.com)
With location prompt (https://unique-fairies.surge.sh)

# Important notice

Highcharts is a paid service. Used it for fun as development. Will be removing it ASAP or use it's paid service or use a free charting package.

# Troubleshooting

Please search cities immediately or it will trigger thousands of API and since free subscription is being used; account may get locked.
THough delay/debouncing has been applied to minize this behavior.

# To do

There are aspects of improvement which couldn't be achieved due to time crunch.
Sun chart could be made dynamic.
Input placeholder update of cities in edge cases which is missing as of now.
Icon for search in input box.
Better loading indicator without third package library.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
